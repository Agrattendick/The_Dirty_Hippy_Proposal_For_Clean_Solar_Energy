# The Dirty Hippy Proposal for Clean Solar Energy

## Description
This project uses Google's [Project Sunroof](https://www.google.com/get/sunroof) data to examine the costs and benefits solar panel installation on individual homes. Right now roofs keep us dry and protect us from the elements. Can they do more? (The null hypothisis is no. Current Panels are too expensive and not efficient enough to provide a benefit.)

## Possible Complications
Google provides some wonderful data, and this report relies heavily on their datasets. Their outlook is bright, however in some ways their datasets are incomplete. For example their sunny disposition shines through in their yearly_sunlight_kwh_kw_threshold_avg computation. Google assumes a loss of 25% of sunlight over a year. Using the Open Weather Map API, this information is replaced with a more accurate figure by area. Southern California may lose less than 25% while New Jersey weather might consume more.

Another issue is existing power plants. More importantly the type of existing plants. If the main power source for a house is a coal plant, solar panels on a personal residence might provide a benefit. If the power plant uses nuclear or renewable sources for energy there is no carbon offset. This project will look at the amount of power produced by each energy source on a state level, and factor that into the possible benefits for home based solar panels.

## Datasets
* Google Project Sunroof CSV Files:
    * Projected Power generated by roofs in searched areas
    * Projected CO2 offset.

* Open Weather Map API:
    * Cloudiness of searched area.

* Power Consumption PDF:
    * Ammount of electricity from fossil fuels, nuclear power, and renewable energy by state.

## 3 - 5 Initial Research Questions:
* Are personal solar panels a benefit for homeowners?
    * what is the financial benefit of solar power v. cost of installation?

* Does living in a high density or low density housing make a difference?

* How does a community benefit from personal solar panels for homeowners?
    * How much carbon offset is provided by solar cells?
    * How much power is currently provided by fossil fuels?
